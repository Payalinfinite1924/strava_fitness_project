# 🏃 Strava Fitness Project

## 📖 Overview
The **Strava Fitness Project** is a data analysis and visualization project built using **Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit**.  
It analyzes workout data (running, cycling, etc.) to provide insights into performance, calories burned, distance covered, and workout consistency.  

This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-based trend analysis
- Interactive dashboards using Streamlit
